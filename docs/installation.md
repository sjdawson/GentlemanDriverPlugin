# Installation

To install GentlemanDriverPlugin for use in SimHub, [download the latest release](https://github.com/sjdawson/GentlemanDriverPlugin/releases)
from the GitHub releases page. Close SimHub and run the installer.

The installer should do most of the heavy lifting for you, including locating
your default SimHub directory. If the installer hasn't correctly located your
SimHub installation, point it at the root directory of SimHub (where
`SimHubWPF.exe` is located).

Follow the rest of the installer's instructions, and run SimHub when it's done.
SimHub should detect the new plugin on launch, and ask if you want to enable it.

Hit "yes", and congratulations, GentlemanDriverPlugin is up and running!
